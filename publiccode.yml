    shortDescription: A library for generating a ready-to-use project skeleton from self-contained Git-hosted templates.
    longDescription: >
      This library allows teams to bootstrap new projects by generating complete,
      ready-to-use codebases from existing project templates stored in Git repositories.
      Unlike typical initializer tools, it bases the generated output on real, tested,
      and version-controlled projects. Templates can evolve independently of the
      initializer, benefit from their own CI/CD pipelines, and be expanded with new
      options via configuration.
    features:
      - Generates codebases from version-controlled, tested Git-based templates
      - Provides a simple UI for selecting and configuring templates
      - Allows adding new templates through configuration
